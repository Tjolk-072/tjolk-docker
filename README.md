# Neon Local Connect VS Code Extension

Connect any app to any Neon branch over localhost. Branch, test, and reset database branches from your IDE using Docker-based [Neon Local](https://github.com/neondatabase-labs/neon_local) under the hood.

## ‚ú® Features

- Create and connect to Neon branches using a local connection string without leaving your IDE.
- Easily incorporate ephemeral Neon branches into your local development and testing workflows.
- Query your database in your terminal or via the Neon console from your IDE.
- Supports both Postgres and Neon serverless drivers.
- The extension manages a Neon Local Docker container for you, no manual Docker commands required.

## üìã Requirements

- Docker must be installed and running
- VS Code 1.85.0 or later
- A [Neon account](https://neon.tech)

## üöÄ Quick start

### 1. **Install the extension**

Find "Neon Local Connect" in the VS Code Marketplace and click **Install**.

### 2. **Sign in to Neon**
Open the Neon Local Connect panel in the sidebar (look for the Neon logo).

Click **Sign in** (OAuth) or **Import API Key**.

OAuth sign in will ask to launch authentication in an external browser.

If you choose the API method, your access and refresh tokens (or API key) are securely stored and encrypted by the extension.

### 3. **Connect to a branch**

You have two main choices:

- **Existing branch:**  
  Use this if you want to connect to a long-lived branch (like `main`, `development`, or a feature branch) that you or your team will use repeatedly. This is best for ongoing development, team collaboration, or when you want your changes to persist.

- **Ephemeral branch:**  
  Choose this for a temporary, disposable branch that's created just for your current session. Perfect for testing, experiments, or CI runs. Your branch (and any changes) will be automatically deleted when you disconnect.

In both cases, you'll be asked to choose your driver type: **PostgreSQL** for most Postgres connections, or **Neon serverless** for edge or HTTP. [Read the docs for more info on choosing a connection type.](https://neon.com/docs/connect/choose-connection)

### 4. **Use the static connection string**

After connecting, you can find your local connection string in the **Local Connection Details** section of the extension panel. Select your database from the dropdown to see and copy the connection string for use in your app's `.env` or config:

Example `.env`:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://neon:npg@localhost:5432/neondb"
```

### 5. **Run your app**

Your app now talks to Neon via `localhost:5432`. No code changes needed when you switch branches!

**Example:**

```js
// Node.js example using pg or @neondatabase/serverless
const { Client } = require('pg'); // or require('@neondatabase/serverless')
const client = new Client({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL });
await client.connect();
```

or

```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL
```

## üñ±Ô∏è Panel actions

Once connected, the Neon Local Connect panel provides quick access to common database operations:

- **Reset from Parent Branch:** Instantly reset your branch to match its parent's state.  
  [Docs: Branch reset][https://neon.com/docs/guides/reset-from-parent)
- **Open SQL Editor:** Launch the Neon SQL Editor in your browser for advanced queries.  
  [Docs: SQL Editor](https://neon.com/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor)
- **Open Table View:** Browse your database schema and data in the Neon Console.  
  [Docs: Tables](https://neon.com/docs/guides/tables)
- **Launch PSQL:** Open a psql shell in the integrated terminal for direct SQL access.  
  [Docs: Using psql with Neon](https://neon.com/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor)

## üí° Why this matters

- No more dynamic connection strings, just use `localhost:5432` everywhere.
- Switch branches for features, tests, or teammates without touching your app code.
- Works with any language or framework that supports Postgres.
- All the power of [Neon Local](https://github.com/neondatabase-labs/neon_local) with a simple VS Code UI.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- Docker must be running for the extension to work.
- If you see "connection refused," check that Docker is running and port 5432 is available.
